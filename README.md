# Bayesian Statistics

Implementing Bayesian Inference to analytical problems.

# US Presidential Candidate Prediction

Using tweets, we predict whether Trump or Clinton wrote them.
NLP was used as to prepare unstructured data for modeling. We compare how a Naive Bayes classifier performs using Frequentist Statistics and Bayesian Statistics (Laplace Smoothing). We also employ a new algorithm for text analytics: TF-IDF.

# Conjugate priors simulation

Given a Gamma prior and exponentially distributed data points, we derive the marginal and predictive distribution of the data.
We also propose a mixture framework for combining prior beliefs.

# Predicting Heart Disease

A Generalized Linear Model, concretely, a logistic regression, is estimated to predict whether a patient had a heart disease or not.
Feature selection is carried out with L1 Regularization or LASSO regression and then Frequentist and Bayesian Inference are compared.
